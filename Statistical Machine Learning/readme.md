# Statistical Machine Learning Algorithms
Hi, I am Ruwen. This directory contains the implementation of two popular statistical machine learning algorithms: K-Means clustering and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification. 
</br>
These algorithms are fundamental in the field of machine learning and can be used for various data analysis and pattern recognition tasks.

## Overview
The repository provides two key machine learning algorithms:

1. K-Means Clustering
   K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for data clustering. It partitions data into clusters based on similarity, where each cluster represents a group of similar data points.

2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It aims to find a decision boundary that maximizes the margin between different classes in the data.
