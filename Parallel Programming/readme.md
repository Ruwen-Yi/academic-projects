# Parallel Programming with Foster's Method in C

Hi, I am Ruwen. This directory contains a simple implementation of parallel programming in C using Foster's method. 

[Foster's method](https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/lam2mo/cs470_2017_01/files/13_fosters_examples.pdf) is a high-level parallel programming model that simplifies the development of parallel applications.
