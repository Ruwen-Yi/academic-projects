# Academic Projects
This repository contains my three academic projects: Statistical Machine Learning, Parallel Programming, and Socket Programming. 
The project is designed to provide a practical understanding of these domains through a cohesive implementation.

## Overview
1. Statistical Machine Learning: In this part of the project, you will find machine learning models and algorithms used for statistical analysis, including SVM and K-Means.

2. Parallel Programming: The parallel programming aspect of this project focuses on the implementation of parallel processing techniques to optimize the performance of machine learning algorithms. You can expect to see Pthread and OpenCL.

3. Socket Programming: Socket programming is used for network communication. In this part of the project, you might find a web server applications that manages ports, connections, and responses.
